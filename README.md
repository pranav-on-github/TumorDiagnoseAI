# TumorDiagnoseAI

TumorDiagnoseAI is a Real-Time Multi class Brain Tumor Classifier which aims to provide clinicians with a powerful tool for expedited and accurate brain tumor classification. The current reliance on manual classification of brain tumors through MRI studies can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Our deep learning-based system seeks to bridge this gap by offering an efficient and automated solution that aids in health monitoring and early detection.

The developed web application employs state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for multiclass brain tumor classification, encompassing glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and benign tumor types. The dataset used in this study comprises 3264 MR images, with 2870 images allocated for training and 394 for testing. By harnessing the potential of CNNs, our project endeavors to achieve a satisfactory level of accuracy in distinguishing and categorizing these diverse brain tumor types based on MRI image sets.
